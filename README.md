Welcome! I'm sure if you are here that you have found room404comic.com by now. If you have no feel free to check us out. You can also quickly get there from visiting http://Fredghostkyle.github.com/Room404 If that is easier for you. 

What this is
=====
This GitHub repo is designed for a WebComic. We have all the HTML, CSS, JS and PhP hosted for you to look at and make fun of. We currently have two sample comics on the website (basicly the actual comic can't be downloaded from Github).
